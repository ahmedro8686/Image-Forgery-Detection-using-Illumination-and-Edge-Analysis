Image Forgery Detection using Illumination and Edge Analysis

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This MATLAB project detects potential forged or manipulated regions in digital images by analyzing illumination inconsistencies, edge structures, and statistical anomalies.
The method combines multiple image processing techniques to highlight suspicious areas and generate a detailed report.

ðŸ›  Features

Illumination Map Analysis â€“ Detects unnatural lighting variations.

Edge Detection â€“ Finds sharp and unusual boundaries.

Z-score Statistical Analysis â€“ Identifies abnormal pixel values across features.

Automatic or Manual Thresholding â€“ Uses Otsuâ€™s method or a fixed threshold.

Noise Removal â€“ Eliminates small irrelevant regions.

Region Property Extraction â€“ Calculates area, centroid, bounding box, and more.

Multiple Output Formats â€“ Saves results as annotated images, overlays, and summary grids.

Detailed Report Generation â€“ Exports a text file with all analysis parameters and statistics.
